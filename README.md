# StoneBlock

# All issues created without using the templates will be closed and ignored 

This modpack is kinda like SkyBlock except you don't start with a tree and you're surrounded by stone.
It's a kitchen-sink modpack with lots of quests to help guide you at the start and to give players goals to reach.

## Requirements

With over 200 mods, **StoneBlock is not a lightweight pack!**

* The [Twitch App](https://app.twitch.tv/) or [MultiMc](https://multimc.org/) to download it
* At least 4-6GB of RAM allocated to the pack
* A decent CPU

## Notes

* Choose the world type "Void? World" in single-player, or "voidworld" on servers
* If something regarding quests or quests rewards is mentiond in the update log, do "/bq_admin default load" and "/bqs_loot default load" to update your questbook
* [CurseForge page](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/stoneblock)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### My game is crashing on startup/freezing during world load, what do I do? (Or alternatively, how do I allocate the minimum 4 gigabytes of RAM?)

If your game crashes while launching and the crash log has a line like `Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded` or `Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`, it's because the game has run out of RAM. StoneBlock needs a minimum of 4 gigabytes—but ideally 6—to run.

Go to Twitch settings and make sure the amount of RAM is at least 5 or 6 gigabytes:
